when testing to create keybinds for spotify there were some key issues that arose.
the final version, named "spotify keybinds.exe", which is located on the main
branch contains different methods to achieving the desired result.



- WinActivate appears to not work after using the command "run" to open the
application and when hiding/showing the window. this results in the 
controlfocus and controlsend not working. to resolve this a left click is performed
after each function which allows the control functions to work (using the MouseClick
function)

note. if the left click performed is on the spotify window this will also cause
the control functions to not go through in which a manual click from the mouse 
elsewhere will fix the issue.

- WinMinimize and WinMaximize have similar problems and in the previous testing
either had no functionality or only partially worked. the solution was to use WinHide
and WinShow.

- WinExist caused further issues coupled with the prior problems. this solution was
inspired and implemented from user - jcsteh on github



the code is a current working version based on user - jcsteh/SpotifyGlobalKeys.ahk
code. the code uses ahk version is the 1.1.36.02 so i recommend any adjustments/
improvements made be set to the same

if you have any issues pop a question and i will try and answer as best as i can
with my limited knowledge/experience using this langauge. also, im trying to implement 
some additonal features and reliability fixes so will update once done


the controls:
- play/pause = CTRL + ALT + DOWN (arrow key)
- next song = CTRL + ALT + RIGHT (the plusses indicates three buttons pushed together)
- previous song = CTRL + ALT + LEFT
- hide/show window = CTRL + ALT + UP
- run spotify = CTRL + ALT + p (needs to be run first before doing other functions)

additional functionality:
- all controls work while the window is not on screen
- if on multiple desktops and want to move the spotify window to each one follow these 
steps:
1) minimise the window using CTRL + ALT + UP
2) switch desktop using WIN + LEFT/RIGHT (arrow key)
3) repeat step one and it should show up
