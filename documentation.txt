when testing to create keybinds for spotify there were some key issues that arose.
any script/executable file in the working versions folder will work, but best to check
the controls folder and find the corresponding file to see what features it has. 
i recommned using the latest version as it might include:
- imporvements to reliability/cleaner code
- more features

few things i ran into when developing the scripts:

- WinActivate appears to not work after using the command "run" (or just in general) to open the application and when hiding/showing the window. this results in the 
controlfocus and controlsend not working. to resolve this a left click is performed
after each function which allows the control functions to work (using the MouseClick
function)

note. if the left click performed is on the spotify window this will also cause
the control functions to not go through in which a manual click from the mouse 
elsewhere will fix the issue.

- WinMinimize and WinMaximize have similar problems and in the previous testing
either had no functionality or only partially worked. the solution was to use WinHide
and WinShow.

- WinExist caused further issues coupled with the prior problems. this solution was
inspired and implemented from user - jcsteh on github

the code is a current working version based on user - jcsteh/SpotifyGlobalKeys.ahk
code. the code uses ahk version is the 1.1.36.02 so i recommend any adjustments/
improvements made be set to the same

if you have any issues pop a question and i will try and answer as best as i can
with my limited knowledge/experience using this langauge. also, im trying to implement 
some additonal features and reliability fixes so will update once done
